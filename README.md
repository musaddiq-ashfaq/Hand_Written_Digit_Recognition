This repository contains a handwritten digit recognition system implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal of this project is to accurately classify and predict handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is designed to take an image of a handwritten digit as input and predict the corresponding digit (0-9).
